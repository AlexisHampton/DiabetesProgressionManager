# DiabetesProgressionManager
 A Patient Diabetes Progression Predictor using a Random Forest and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html"> SciKit's Diabetes Dataset </a>. It allows Users (doctors) to log in and predict their patient's diabetes progression based on new data such as age, total cholesterol, BMI, and blood sugar levels. 
 
 This project was made by:
<br> <a href="https://github.com/AlexisHampton">Alexis Hampton</a>: who coded the Random Forest and Decision Tree Logic, 
<br> <a href="https://github.com/bilques">Bilques Jan</a>: who coded the user interactions and database logic,
<br> and <a href="https://github.com/ayshamukhtar">Aysha Mukhtar</a>: who handled the client communications and helped manage the entire project.

Together we each created a project that is not finished. It is still a work in progress and will hopefully be finished by the end of the semester.
